					A little intro to myself...
				</h2>
				<p> 
					Hello, my name is Mickey Harrington. I am a San Diego native, born and raised in Chula Vista. I am currently 38 years old. I enjoy being outdoors, going on road-trips and spending time with my wife and two kids. My wife and I recently celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I am taking this course to learn more about web development with the hopes of eventually pivoting out of retail and into something related to web development or graphic design. I have spent over 20 years in the retail industry and I am ready to try something different. I have minimal web development exposure, most of it just from what Iâ€™ve learned in these classes. I hope that with these classes I have been taking I will grow a little more confident with the new skills i am learning.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Taking these classes in web development is more than just trying to change careers. Of course finding a new career is what brought me to taking web development classes. What I want to do is be able to find a job where i can work from home. I want to be able to see my wife and kids more. I want to be able to travel with my family during holidays. Working in retail you can not ask for vacation time during the holidays because its the busiest time. I want to have the knowledge and confidence to do something else other than retail. Working in retail is simple and repetitive. I want to help start a business with my wife and create a website for it. And maybe after taking these classes gaining new knowledge it ends up not being for me, then at least I tried something new. I don't want my children to just accept life and settle. I want them to take risks and try new things. I can't exactly be that spokesman if i dont practice what i preach.
